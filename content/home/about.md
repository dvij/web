# Biography

I am a research scientist at <a href="https://deepmind.com"> DeepMind</a>. My current research focus is on building robust and verifiable AI systems that can be trusted to behave reasonably even under adversarial circumstances (see <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/krishnamurthy-dvijotham-5-3-18"> this talk</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SV9e5JtAltiz3lhtcov1Np8rmk_gyoX_/view?usp=sharing"> these slides </a> for a summary of my recent research).

More generally, I am interested in developing algorithms to guarantee correct behavior in complex autonomous systems. My PhD thesis focused on efficient algorithms for stochastic optimal control and reinforcement learning in risk-sensitive situations (see <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3715>this</a> and <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.0554> this</a>). I also worked on applying ideas from robust and risk averse control to electric power grids with high penetrations of uncertain renewable generation sources like wind and solar energy (see <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8454506"> this </a> and <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7962164"> this </a>), before moving to DeepMind.

My research has received several best paper awards at AI conferences (<a href=http://auai.org/uai2018/index.php> UAI 2018</a>, <a href=http://cp2016.a4cp.org/> CP 2016 </a>, <a href=http://auai.org/uai2014/> UAI 2014 </a> and <a href=http://www.ecmlpkdd2008.org/> ECML 2008</a>). My work at DeepMind has also been incorporated into <a href=https://deepmind.com/blog/deepmind-meet-android/> AI-based battery management solutions for android phones.</a>
